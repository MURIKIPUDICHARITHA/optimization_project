# ðŸ§  Optimization Using Linear Programming

This project demonstrates how to solve a business problem using linear programming and Python with the PuLP library.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem

A furniture company wants to maximize its profit by producing two products: **chairs** and **tables**. The profit for each is:
- Chair: â‚¹20
- Table: â‚¹30

### ðŸ”’ Constraints:
- Labor: 100 hours available
- Wood: 90 units available
- Each chair: 2 hours labor, 3 units wood
- Each table: 4 hours labor, 2 units wood

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Maximize profit while staying within the labor and wood constraints.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Python 3
- [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) (Linear Programming Solver)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Output

The notebook:
- Defines the optimization problem
- Solves it using PuLP
- Displays the optimal number of chairs and tables to produce
- Shows the maximum achievable profit
